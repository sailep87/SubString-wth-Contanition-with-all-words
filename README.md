## Introduction

In many applications, you may need to identify specific patterns or substrings within a larger text. This repository provides a simple yet effective way to find substrings that contain all specified words. Whether you are working on a search engine, a data analysis tool, or just need to process text, this project can help.

## Features

- Efficient substring search
- Supports multiple words
- Easy to integrate into existing projects
- Well-documented code

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sailep87/SubString-wth-Contanition-with-all-words.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SubString-wth-Contanition-with-all-words
```

You may need to install any dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the substring search functionality, you can run the main script. Make sure to have your input string and the words you want to search for ready.

Here's a simple command to execute the script:

```bash
python main.py "Your input string here" "word1" "word2" "word3"
```

Replace `"Your input string here"` with the text you want to search, and `"word1"`, `"word2"`, and `"word3"` with the words you want to find.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how to use the project:

### Example 1

Input: 

```bash
python main.py "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" "quick" "fox"
```

Output: 

```
Found substring: "quick brown fox"
```

### Example 2

Input:

```bash
python main.py "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" "rain" "Spain" "plain"
```

Output:

```
Found substring: "rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain"
```
